arxiv	Alan M. Turing: The Applications of Probability to Cryptography	Ian Taylor	2015-05-18 16:42:32	http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04714v2	This is a typeset version of Alan Turing's Second World War research paper \textit{The Applications of Probability to Cryptography}. A companion paper \textit{Paper on Statistics of Repetitions} is also available in typeset form from arXiv at arXiv:1505.04715. The original papers give a text along with figures and tables. They provide a fascinating insight into the preparation of the manuscripts, as well as the style of writing at a time when typographical errors were corrected by hand, and mathematical expression handwritten into spaces left in the text. Working with the papers in their original format provides some challenges, so they have been typeset for easier reading and access.	['Ian Taylor']

arxiv	Alan Baker	David Masser	2020-10-17 08:49:59	http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10256v1	Alan Baker, Fields Medallist, died on 4th February 2018 in Cambridge England after a severe stroke a few days earlier.   In 1970 he was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress in Nice on the basis of his outstanding work on linear forms in logarithms and its consequences. Since then he received many honours including the prestigious Adams Prize of Cambridge University, the election to the Royal Society (1973) and the Academia Europaea; and he was made an honorary fellow of University College London, a foreign fellow of the Indian Academy of Science, a foreign fellow of the National Academy of Sciences India, an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.   In this article we survey Alan Baker's achievements.	['David Masser']

In this note we show that the construction we gave with P. Antonini does indeed provide non-trivial representations.	['Iakovos Androulidakis']
arxiv	Atom-anchored LLMs speak Chemistry: A Retrosynthesis Demonstration	unknown	2025-10-18 17:27:44	http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16590v1	Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed. Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing data scarcity.

arxiv	Mind the Retrosynthesis Gap: Bridging the divide between Single-step and Multi-step Retrosynthesis Prediction	unknown	2022-12-12 18:06:24	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11809v1	Retrosynthesis is the task of breaking down a chemical compound recursively step-by-step into molecular precursors until a set of commercially available molecules is found. Consequently, the goal is to provide a valid synthesis route for a molecule. As more single-step models develop, we see increasing accuracy in the prediction of molecular disconnections, potentially improving the creation of synthetic paths. Multi-step approaches repeatedly apply the chemical information stored in single-step retrosynthesis models. However, this connection is not reflected in contemporary research, fixing either the single-step model or the multi-step algorithm in the process. In this work, we establish a bridge between both tasks by benchmarking the performance and transfer of different single-step retrosynthesis models to the multi-step domain by leveraging two common search algorithms, Monte Carlo Tree Search and Retro*. We show that models designed for single-step retrosynthesis, when extended to multi-step, can have a tremendous impact on the route finding capabilities of current multi-step methods, improving performance by up to +30% compared to the most widely used model. Furthermore, we observe no clear link between contemporary single-step and multi-step evaluation metrics, showing that single-step models need to be developed and tested for the multi-step domain and not as an isolated task to find synthesis routes for molecules of interest.

arxiv	Incomputability after Alan Turing	S. Barry Cooper	2013-04-22 19:02:47	http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6363v1	Incomputability as a mathematical notion arose from work of Alan Turing and Alonzo Church in the 1930s. Like Turing himself, it attracted less attention than it deserved beyond the confines of mathematics. Today our experiences in computer science, physics, biology, artificial intelligence, economics and the humanities point to the importance of the notion for understanding the world around us. This article takes a Turing centenary look at how the interface between the computable world and the incomputable formed a central theme in Turing's work - from the early establishment of the standard model of the stored program computer, to the late work on emergence of form in nature, and the first approaches to understanding and simulating human intelligence. Turing's thinking was remarkably prescient, and his legacy still impacts on much of our work. The incomputable may turn out to be a specially important part of the legacy, with consequences that Alan Turing himself could not have envisaged.	['S. Barry Cooper']
